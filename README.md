# Awesome Books Library

> "Awesome books" is a simple website that displays a list of books and allows you to add and remove books from that list. By building this application, we will learn how to manage data using JavaScript. Thanks to that our website will be more interactive. We will also use a medium-fidelity wire-frame to build the UI.
